# lexers

This repository contains some experimentation with building lexers. My goal with
this project is to build a couple of different types of lexers with different features
to get to know how to build good lexers.

I am working on implementing the following types of lexers:

- [Recursive descent lexer](./recursive_descent/)
- Backtracking lexer
- State machine lexer

Additionally, I am working on implementing a "more production-ready" lexer, where
I take my learnings from previous experiments and implement more features that I
would want in a production-ready lexer, such as source spans.
